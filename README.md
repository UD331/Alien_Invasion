Alien Invasion is a 80's style shooter video game created in Python with the help of pygame. The game consists of the player controlling their own spaceshup as they shoot aliens 
and progress through levels. The game is created from the ideas and help presented in the book "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"
